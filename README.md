# eidolon-dupreanum-henipavirus

This github repo contains documentation of analyses for the Madagascar bat henipavirus paper. Goal of this repo is to document analysis to define which samples from the urine dataset have detectable henipavirus signal, to assemble full genome for that henipavirus, and to build a phylogeny of the resulting genomes. Additionally, we undertake a few simple ecological analyses to highlight the seasonality of bat virus shedding.

The repo contains sub-directories with scripts and data to make each figure, as well as directions here for the pipeline used to determine which samples are "positive" for the pathogen of interest (in this case, henipaviruses).

Beyond these details, all scripts to produce each figure should be self-contained and output results to the "final-figures" folder.
